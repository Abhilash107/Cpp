Ranges and Sizes of Data Types in C++:

### Integer Types:
- #### int: 
  - Size: 4 bytes
  - Range (signed): -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
  - Range (unsigned): 0 to 4,294,967,295

- #### long (32-bit systems): 
  - Size: 4 bytes
  - Range (signed): -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
  - Range (unsigned): 0 to 4,294,967,295

- #### long (64-bit systems): 
  - Size: 8 bytes
  - Range (signed): -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
  - Range (unsigned): 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615

### Floating-Point Types:
- #### float: 
  - Size: 4 bytes
  - Precision: ~6-7 digits
  - Range: ±1.2e-38 to ±3.4e38

- #### double: 
  - Size: 8 bytes
  - Precision: ~15-16 digits
  - Range: ±2.3e-308 to ±1.7e308

- #### long double: 
  - Size: 8-16 bytes (platform-dependent)
  - Precision: ~18-19 digits (or higher)
  - Range: Typically larger than double, e.g., ±3.4e-4932 to ±1.1e4932 (platform-dependent)

### Long Long Data Type in C++:

  Size: 8 bytes
  Range: -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807

- unsigned long long: 
  Size: 8 bytes
  Range: 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615
